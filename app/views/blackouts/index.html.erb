<% title "Blackout Dates" %>

<p class="lead">
  If a user tries to create a reservation for any of the equipment models listed
  below with a start date or end date within
  the "Blackout" period, then they will be presented with a notice (set by
  the admin) stating the exceptional circumstances for that date (e.g. 'Please
  note that our offices will only be open from 2:36 AM to 2:37 AM on this date
  in observance of Arbitrary Day.'). The admin can also set that no reservation
  can be created if its start or end
  date falls within the Blackout period.
