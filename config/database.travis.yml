# This database.yml is for use by Travis CI. All this information must be
# provided so Travis CI can actually build and test our app. It cannot
# be removed and replaced by a database.yml.example file, because this is
# configuration information necessary for Travis CI to build the app. For more
# information, see http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#MySQL
#
# It is possible that with any further changes in the future we'll need to
# update this configuration for Travis CI to build. Always check the Travis CI
# build status for the latest information.
