Reservations makes it easy to manage the checking in and out of equipment, much like a library! Here are some of the things Reservations can do:

* manage your inventory of equipment, including storing serial numbers, manuals and other documents, and more.
* present an attractive catalog of equipment, including pictures, so people can browse and search your equipment.
* allow people to reserve equipment in advance, according to rules you set.
* enforce rules on who can reserve what equipment, and for how long.
* manage checking in/out equipment, including unique checklists for each item.

Getting Started
===============

There are two mains steps to setting up Reservations: setting up a deployment server, and installing the Reservations application.

### Prerequisites
You'll need the following to run Reservations:
* [Ruby 2.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* a database server ([MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) or any database supported by Rails)
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)
* [GhostScript](http://www.ghostscript.com/)
* a [CAS](http://www.jasig.org/cas) authentication system (optional)

### Installation

For troubleshooting, see [our wiki](https://github.com/YaleSTC/wiki/wiki).

First, checkout a copy of Reservations using git:

```
cd /your/code/directory
git clone https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations.git
cd reservations
```

Reservations uses [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to manage dependencies, so if you don't have it, get it, then install dependencies:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

You'll need to edit config/database.yml to point to your database, including the correct username and password. See [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database) for common database examples. We package a few example files in the ```config/``` folder for Ubuntu, Fedora, and OS X.

Then, create the database and load the database structure:

```
rake db:create
rake db:schema:load
```

Finally, start the app locally:

```rails server```

Just point your browser to ```localhost:3000``` to use Reservations.

### Deploying to a Server

Reservations is built using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and can be set up (deployed) like most Rails apps. You'll need a server running with the following software:

* [Ruby 2.1](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* database server ([MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is preferred, but any database supported by Rails should work, including PostgreSQL)
* web server ([apache](http://apache.org/) or [nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) both work well)
* Rails application server (usually [Passenger Phusion](http://www.modrails.com/) aka mod_rails)

For a general guide to setting up your web and application servers, including hosting providers, see the [Rails Deployment Guide](http://rubyonrails.org/deploy/). For a guide to using our [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/) deployment script, see the [wiki](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations/wiki/Capistrano-Deployment-Guide). For a guide to deploying Reservations to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), see the [wiki](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations/wiki/Heroku-Deployment-Guide) as well.

### Configuration
Reservations uses environment variables for configuration (following the principles of the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config)). The gems [`dotenv`](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) and [`dotenv-deployment`](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv-deployment) can be used to simulate system environment variables at runtime.

In the `development` and `test` Rails environments, most of the configuration is set in the `config/secrets.yml` file. **IMPORTANT** You should copy the `config/secrets.yml` file and regenerate all of the secret keys / tokens using `rake secret`. You should also copy over the `config/database.yml.example.*` file relevant to your platform and follow the instructions linked to above to set up your database.

In `production`, the `config/database.yml.example.production` should be used as it will refer to the relevant environment variables. Additionally, you must define most of the configuration environment variables listed [here](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations/wiki/Configuration) in order for Reservations to work.

#### Authentication
By default, Reservations uses e-mail addresses and passwords to authenticate users with the [`devise`](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise) gem. It also supports the CAS authentication system, using the gem [`devise_cas_authenticatable`](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise_cas_authenticatable). If you want to use CAS authentication you must set the `CAS_AUTH` and `CAS_BASE_URL` environment variables to the appropriate values (see [here](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations/wiki/Configuration#authentication) for more details). Switching between authentication methods after initial setup is possible with some caveats (see our [wiki](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations/wiki/Authentication#switching-authentication-methods) for more details).

To point the gem to the correct CAS server in the development and test Rails environments, modify the following setting in your app's `config/secrets.yml` file (see [above](#configuration)):
```yaml
  cas_base_url: https://secure.its.yale.edu/cas/
```
Change the `cas_base_url` parameter to your CAS server's base URL; also note that many CAS servers are configured with a base URL that looks more like “cas.example.com/cas”.

#### Time Zone
Reservations ships with the default config time set to Eastern Time (US and Canada). To change the time, edit `config/application.rb`
`config.time_zone = 'Eastern Time (US & Canada)'`.
